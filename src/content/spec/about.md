# About Sweet Shiba Sketches  
**Where 'UwU' Meets Toxic Positivity**

Sweet Shiba Sketches is what happens when chaotic doodles, questionable humor, and dangerously cute animals get locked in the same room with too many pastel markers and zero supervision.

This is the home of **DeerDog**, **Digi**, and **Mimi**—a trio of illustrated nonsense who live inside the world of *Big Desert*. From silly comics to edgy merch drops, everything here is drawn, written, and screamed into existence by the same creative brain soup that thought:  
**"What if cringe... but cute?"**

Whether you're here to escape reality, cry-laugh over a comic, or just vibe with a voiceless shiba mascot who may or may not be plotting something, you're in the right place.

## What We Believe

- Cringe is power  
- Cuteness is a weapon  
- Art doesn’t need to be serious to be good  
- Everything should be just a little bit unhinged

## Meet the Crew

**DeerDog**  
The chaotic artist child trapped in a sketchbook. Draws like it’s 2am and the assignment is due at 2:01. Cringe incarnate.

**Digi**  
The “grown-up.” Marketable. Sarcastic. Pretends he’s in charge. He isn’t.

**Mimi**  
The SweetSheeb. Voiceless. Expressionless. Flawless. Cheeks: maxed out. Cringe: weaponized.

## What’s Big Desert?

*Big Desert* is the ever-expanding narrative world where all of Sweet Shiba Sketches unfolds. It’s the sandbox for comics, chaos, and whatever else happens when DeerDog isn’t being supervised.

If a story feels like you stumbled in halfway through a fever dream... good. That’s how you know it’s from here.
